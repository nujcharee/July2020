They make it her business to get to know my children.  They make them feel at ease in appointments and is careful to be very honest with my children which means they learn to trust health practitioners.  \\n\\nI also like the way they consult with colleagues if they think the questions I'm asking are outside of their experience. \\n\\nMy doctor is available for phone appointments which I find very helpful, and face to face appointments.  They don't make me feel rushed in appointments. \\n\\nThe reception staff are polite, kind, and helpful. They work hard to ensure my family can see a doctor as soon as possible.

I feel sorry for the doctors, but they do a marvelous job. I took my son in the evening to the surgery, the doctor still with a big smile on their face. You can call 8.00am in the Morning and the same day you can see a doctor. The surgery provides a very good service. The staff is friendly. Further, the telephone consolidation is also a very good service.': 1, '1.\\nIf you are waiting and the doctor is running considerably late on appointments they do not tell how long you will probably be kept waitng.\\n\\n2.\\nIf you are one minute late for you appointment they will not see you even though you are still in your allocated time of appointment. It is not unusual to wait for more than 50 mins. Patients are real people just like doctors and also have a schedule to keep\\n\\n3.\\nThe doctor may tell you after a visit to book an appointment in say two weeks time but when you get to the reception they will probably tell you that is not possible.': 1, \"This so called teaching surgery uses its patients as guinea pigs to further itself. Continuity of treating doctors is appalling. If you get to see the same doctor twice in a row it's a miracle. You don't get the prescriptions which secondary care has recommended (obviously it dents their budget). Newly trained GP's can't make decisions for themselves which is constant and locums can't use the computer system. I actually had a consultation 2 weeks ago where the doctor propped the door open with a chair so everyone outside could hear my appointment/discussion. A GP refused me medication once because it was against their religion!!! You have to check every prescpription you are given for errors which happen frequently and are only occasionally picked up by the pharmacist. The presciptions I was given today had 2 errors and 2 weeks ago had 2 errors. And even after all the errors you have the pleasure of waiting 30/40/50 minutes to be seen. Personally, I can't wait to leave.\": 1, 'The reception staff are helpful to a point but are governed by ridiculus working practices.': 1, \"Two of the doctors, and the Practice Nurses. (more information on the GP's we've seen in the anything else you'd like to add box below).\": 1, 'I had the privilege of being with the practice for one year. I found their conduct to be of the highest order of integrity and morals. The doctors would often stay late and attend extra meetings to ensure that the needs of the patients and practice were met. I would recommend the surgery to my family and friends. I miss the practice now that I have moved on. I hope the hardwork that they carry out is not lost on their community. Thanks Arshya.': 1, \"The GP's I visited at this pracise were generally very good.\": 1, 'The Doctor I met today was very friendly and helpful. This can be said about all doctors I have met in this surgery, calm and patient.': 1, \"Nothing, was uncomfortable as i got the impression i was wasting the GP's time.\": 1, 'I really like that my GP really cares about my health and wellbeing, as they also cares for others.\\n\\nThe cleanliness of the surgery also impresses me.  I have seen too many clinics/hospitals which have frightened me.': 1, 'All the doctors I have seen, but one, have always been very professional, caring, helpful and prompt in directing me to the right specialist when I was diagnosed with a renal illness.

If the GP thinks they need to see you (yes - it is no longer your decision whether you need to see a GP or not!) then they will book you in for an appointment - but if you work full time you often have to wait a week for an early or a late appointment, so beware it is often over a week from your original call to the surgery to actually seeing a GP. \\n\\nAlso, on an occasion in May I booked a late appointment, and was left in the waiting room for over an hour past my appointed time with no explanation as to why the GP was running so late, and there was no sympathy from the receptionists who are sometimes quite rude. \\n\\nI feel that this surgery has too many patients on its books for the number of GP's, and the new appointment system doesnt work for those in full time employment.

Another time i went to see a GP with an ear infection, the doctor said i have pains because i clench my teeth in my sleep and adviced to buy a dental cast (about £40) to sleep with during the night.

The latest appointment was the last drop of my patience as the doctor was not listening to A WORD i was saying, they ignored everything i tried to explain, when i said i wasn't happy they suggested i change the clinic.

With my plead of my husband's condition, the receptionist could have asked the doctor to sign it off there and then.  But she refused to help.

The next medical appointment they offered was 3 weeks from the day I phoned to arrange this test. A couple of days later they phoned me to ask me if I could come to the surgery the following day, I agreed (suffering really bad from the chest infection at this stage). I had to drive 18 miles from my work place to the surgery and understandable I was 10 mins late due to demands at work and traffic on the A1 etc. When I arrived to the surgery they asked me to fill out the form which I did and ordered me to give a urine sample which I did. When I came back from the toilet with urine sample they refused to take me for the medical as I was 10 mins late. With this I had to take the urine sample with me when I left the surgery.

They are not friendly and seem to want to get rid of you, almost to the point that in the past, they have looked up and barked \"what?\" expecting you to tell details of your health concern there in front of all the other people waiting. Recently, there was a new reception person who was friendly but didn\\'t seem to have any idea what theey were doing - not what you want when you need advice and reassurance that what they are saying is correct.

We have also noticed that one of the doctors did not wash their hands - even after handling feet with a possible infection, they used theeir computer and pen - no washing of any sort seen before or after.': 1, 'I married into a Kidderminster family over 20 years ago and have been a patient of this practice since then. I have over those years gone from a casual user of the services to a regular because of a lifelong condition. The quality of care that myself and my family continue to receive is exemplary. I can say that all the Reception Staff have been helpful, courteous and where an issue may have arisen have been able to resolve it satisfactorily. The management and administration of the practise is informative and knowledgeable, this has meant that we as a family have received the relevant information either we have needed to make enlightened decisions about any family health matters, or notification of changes to the GP Practice including new initiatives.\\n\\nI think that over the years I have seen all the GP’s and I receive understanding, concern and reassurance from these dedicated professionals, indeed a number of the GP team have shown great dedication and patient care beyond expectations. This quality of care has made a positive contribution to my family’s general health and well being.\\n\\nI have over recent years, because of my condition, had to see the practice nurses more often, all of this devoted and professional team take the time and trouble to make sure my care and welfare concerns are answered and that whatever health checks, injections or blood tests have to be done are done with good humour and a reassuringly competent manner.\\n\\nI am very happy to be one of the many well treated patients of this quality GP Practice': 1, 'This is a very modern practice, plenty of parking with easy access.

This means if you telephone for an appointment and you dont mind which doctor you see you can usually get an appointment with 24-48 hours if not the same day.   I can honestly say I have met each doctor during my time registered at this practice and they are all patient, friendly and caring. The only problem I sometimes experience is a delay in seeing a nurse for blood pressure checks,, they tend to get booked up fairly quickly and you usually need to book the same day of your visit for their earliest appointment.

I found the Dr very brusque and, with regard to my REM sleep disorder medication, very unsympathetic.

How am I to get the medication that has been prescribed for a condition (diagnosed by a specialist in the field) if the consulatnt has referred me to my GP for a prescription?

You can call and see what he next available appointments are and cycle through them to find one that suits you best without feeling like you are holding up a receptionist to do this, you also do not have to discuss your medical problem with anyone prior to getting an appointment which is nice.  The fact there is a chemist right next door is useful too.  \\n\\nWhen I first joined the surgery two years ago I had to have a check up and go through my conditions and history etc. I found this really helpful and made me feel like the surgery really cared about making sure they knew everything.

Do you think if I go to my old surgery asking for my file, will they give it to me?

I usually get appointments when requested, and can book on the day or in advance, although for emergency appointments on the day I may have to see whoever is available, which is fine. The reception staff are always polite and helpful, and I've never been patronised or snapped at when they're busy (which has happened at other surgeries). At other surgeries I've sometimes felt like I've received inadequate care because of the silly system of phoning for appointments only at 9am, and when you don't get one being told to phone back at 2pm, or the next day.

Rather than each patient having to take up a 10-minute appointment with a nurse or HCA during surgery hours, they hold a walk-in session for routine blood tests starting at 7am, so patients can drop in before work.

On Wednesday, I called at 8:30am when the phone lines are supposed to open only to be greeted with a message advising the lines were closed. This continued until at least 8:45 when I had to give up. I called throughout the day but was unable to get through. The same happened again on Wednesday and Thursday. I finally got through to the Practice on Friday and was told that all the late night appointments had been booked therefore I would have to take another appointment during the normal hours if the matter was urgent.  When I explained the position I had been in I was told that it couldnt possibly be right as they had been there answering the phones at 8:30am.

I have now booked an appointment but at an inconvenient time.': 1, \"On a number of  occasions I have not been greeted by a pleasant reception but instead expected to wait 3-4 minutes whilst they finished off their conversations. The conversations are often regarding their opinions and judgements on other patients. At the same time they fail to answer the telephone which is left ringing on a regular basis. When I was eventually aowledged by the reception they were very loud and intrusive which made me feel uncomfortable as their was a room full of patients waiting to be seen who could here all conversations. \\n\\nI am also appalled by the GP's lack of time keeping. I am yet to experience an occasion where the doctor is on time to the surgery. Appointments begin from 8am onwards however the doctor leisurely comes in after 9am and then persues to get a cup of tea and speak to staff before they begin consultations. This is completely unacceptable as people have their own commitments which they need to meet.\\n\\nI was eventually seen by the doctor 1hr and 15 minutes after my appointment time. When being seen by the doctor I was greeted by them trying to use his bluetooth headset/iphone which they answer during consultations. This makes me very uncomfortable as it is clear that they is not confident in using the headset properly which could result in who ever is on the phone line hearing my personal information.\\n\\nThe doctor failed to look at me even once throughout my consultation. Instead they pointed me in the direction of the chair and then proceeded to ask me my symptoms which they typed into his computer and then gave me a diagnosis, they did nto look at the problem area even once. \\n\\nI am also extremely unhappy about the GP's lack of patient - doctor confidentiality as I have experienced them telling my aunt about my illness as well as giving my cousins test results to her father. they have also prescribed medication to a relative which it states in the records they are allergic to.\": 1, 'Not much, the atmosphere in the surgery to the staff working there make every visit feel cold and make you feel worse then before.

The attitudes of staff in this practice are outdated, and their behaviour suggests they believe that patients should be seen and not heard.  I would question whether the GPs, particularly the partners, are 'appropriate' for a service in 2010.

Being a concerned mum, I asked when my children would be contacted regarding vaccination, and the receptionist answered 'we're only doing high-risk groups'. And I said, YES, you are, and my children are in such a group as per the NHS website. The receptionist interrupted me and said 'I KNOW WHAT THE NHS WEBSITE SAYS!' Well obviously they didn't as then they wouldn't have used the term 'high risk' group, but rather 'patients with pre-existing conditions'.

Not knowing anything about the condition and having a small baby in the house i asked the receptionist  if i could speak to somebody, anybody just to help me understand the condition and that my baby was not going to be affected. The response i got from the receptionist was to see the doctor in an hour and no one was available to advise me as to what to do. needless to say i spent the next hour worrying, when i finally did see the doctor who i have to say was not very reasureing having to look everything up on the computer we were told there was no treatment and told it would run its coarse.

Also able to call the surgery and ask to speak to the doctor, between certain hours.\\nMost important to me is, this Doctor is not slap happy at handing out prescriptions and willing to talk about alternative treatments.

As on this website offered I had already printed of and filled in the registration form. It was printed out in  black and white but the recepionist didnn\\'t accept it and handed me the same form just blue and white and asked me to fill it in again without an explanation. When I handed back the blue and white registration form they weren\\'t happy with my hand writing and requested my printed of one as well and took both. Then they asked me for my proof of id and I showed them my ID card but according to the practice policy which they read out to me they don\\'t accept ID cards only passports. (Surprisingly every EU country does accept my ID card but not my GP.)  So I walked home and back which took about 25mins. Arriving back at the surgery they looked at my passport and was happy with it. Then they asked me for my address and where exactly it is. I then had to learn that I live just 25 meters out of their catchment area and that they can\\'t registered me. After I told them that I was unhappy about how much time I just wasted when they could have asked me about my address in the first place.

I have NEVER been able to see the same doctor twice in a row. Each doctor prescribes a course of action, that is followed up and contradicted by the next. One doctor prescribes and the results are looked at by a different doctor, who then prescribes a different test. It is absolutely ridiculous, as this makes the process of diagnosing an issue extremely lengthy, inconvenient, and seemingly never ending.\\n\\nEach time I have asked the reception to make a follow up appointment with the same doctor I have been snapped at and told I would have to wait for several days. Yesterday I was told I would have to wait for 21 days if I wish to see the same doctor. I don't know why the practice cannot put in place a system which allows patients to see the same doctor routinely, so that he/she may be familiar with the patients case. This would save both, the patient and the doctor a lot of going in circles, and the NHS at least some money in multiple tests.\\n\\nFurther, there is always a lengthy wait to make an appointment for a blood test - at least 8-10 days every time I have attempted to make an appointment in the past 6 months. They do not allow patients to have their blood work done at any of the many nearby hospitals, which would be much quicker. I am not sure why the practice does not either hire more nurses for blood work, or allow patients to have blood work done at other facilities (as they do at many other practices), if they are so backed up. Having to wait for 2+ weeks to have a blood test and results come in for diagnosis is incredibly frustrating when one is feeling ill.\\n\\nThe Reception at this practice at the worst that I have ever experienced. They are rude and hostile. When one walks into the practice they do not bother to acknowledge or offer to help - but usually continue with their own conversations and ignore the patients until a line forms.\": 1, 'I was very suprised when i read the comments on this page. I dont go to the Drs often but when i do the staff are always helpful, professional and friendly. They are very busy but i have never known them be rude.

I can see from information in the practice that all the Drs there have been there for more than 5 years, even the locum is regular.': 1, \"I moved to the Marylebone health centre about 18 months ago from a very similar practice in the area that I really was not happy with. this was a refreshing move and one that I don't regret at all. I am very lucky that I am generally quite well but have on occasions needed to see a Gp for an acute illness. I appreciate that the appts are limited as this is such a busy practice, but there is the option for book on the day appts or in the case of a clinical emergency you will always be able to get advise from a gp. I think the advise line is a great service. the staff have always been very friendly and are not rude as some other comments have implied. I have been in the waiting room previously and am appalled at the way some people speak to the staff who are there, under a lot of pressure, trying to help patients the best they can.\": 1, 'The reception, the childrens play area, the range and number of services and the Drs and Nurses-i love where its based.': 1, 'One nurse was nice.': 1, \"I've been with the practice for nearly 10 years and have always received excellent health care.\": 1, 'I find the practice reception team excellent, very professional and helpful.

The waiting area is most soothing, due to choice of colours and architecture.\\n\\nAppointment making: if the doctor who regularly follows me is not available, I can always see another practioner, particularly if there is a medical emergency.  Doctors always take the time to explain the medical condition and the relevance of prescribed medicine.': 1, 'Nothing - the only good thing about this Practice is its location. The reception staff, as pointed out by others here, are rude and condescending. While trying to get a copy of some results and at the same time schedule an appointments the receptionist behaved like I was burdening them and they made it seem like they were doing me a favour by doing their job! I complained about two issues that have been mishandled by this practice and the manager assured me that they will get back to me in writing with a full explanation and sadly none of that happened - I am yet to receive an explanation for the way I was treated as a patient here. \\n\\nThe doctors are polite but sadly not very competent - most had to google medical issues/medicines in front of me when asked specific questions about my condition. I came prepared to the next appointment and to avoid being \"dismissed\" I had printed out a few pages from the NHS website and still the doctor said that they \"had no clue\" what this was and had \"never come across it\" then again proceeded to surf the web in front of me! It is a joke. They get annoyed when confronted by a patient who actually reads about their condition and demands accurate information about the treatment proposed. \\n\\nAll in all - I would absolutely never recommend this experience to anyone and would never trust the doctors at this practice with my health.': 1, 'Its close to home and with good opening hours.

When I picked up the registration froms the previous week, I was told to fill them in and return it to the surgery - no one took the time to detail that my husband and I would both need to be present and producing ID. because of my husbands job we have moved around the country a fair bit and I have to say I have never been asked for ID to register at a GP's surgery. nor have I encountered such a rude reception counter.\": 1, 'I was given sms reminders about appointments': 1, \"It's a good practice with helpful, cheerful staff.\": 1, 'Having moved to Alsager from London, I found it such a pleasure to find such efficiency, courteousness from the staff and the doctors.

Nothing is too much trouble for them and they are more than willing to involve me in decisions about my treatment etc. One doctor summed up the whole practice\\'s attitude recently when they said to me \"don\\'t hesitate to let us know whenever you need us - we will always help you\". You can\\'t ask for more than that, in my opinion.\\n\\nNo gp practice can get it right every single time, but I have spent a lot of time in their waiting room and have never observed anyone being treated other than with courtesy and respect (though I have noticed that the staff are not always so lucky).\\n \\nI am thinking of moving house soon, but because this practice is so helpful & supportive to me I am going to make sure I stay within their area!': 1, 'All of the appointments I have had there have been on time which is a major plus! \\nNurses have all been very friendly and helpful, one has even popped in to see the doctor whilst I was there to check something with regard to  my medication!\\nReception staff have all been discreet and very nice.': 1, \"When I eventually reaching a receptionist after the horrible automated system they are unhelpful and unsympathetic, and don't seem to care if you need an appointment immediately/ on a certain day etc. The practise is very badly designed with a very wide desk offering no privacy when speaking with receptionists (who also don't mind that they are practically shouting your personal details to everyone in the waiting area) The doctors are just as unhelpful and impersonal though I do find the nurse practitioners I have met very friendly and helpful. Overall I avoid visiting if i can and if it were not so close and convinient I would definitely change practises.\": 1, 'One doctor seems really nice and speaks to you like you are a human being.

I am a healthcare professional who does not work for the NHS and understand the difficulties which can arise in running a practice.\\n\\nWhen my family and I have had occasion to use this practice, we have found it to be efficient, polite and in general the staff responded appropriately.  I would prefer to be seen by a nurse practitioner than a GP in general, so that's fine by me.  I note that as with my own practice, there is a considerable problem with patients missing or being late for appointments.\": 1, \"I have been registered with the surgery for a year and a half.   During this time, I have only managed to get appointments with a nurse and on one occasion a Doctor who is not my named  Doctor.  I have a long standing disability, since early childhood, with connected medical issues.  I recently managed to get an appointment, however I did not realise it was a locum GP.   I explained that I was informed about new advances to treatment and that I wanted a referral to a Consultant. This was to possibly find a way of managing my condition more effectively than my current patches/ medication.  It is quite an embarrassing and degrading medical issue and I am a young lady.  I feel that the Doctor showed no sympathy or appreciation for the fact that I am a young woman with a horrible and very distressing condition.  They appeared to assume that my long standing symptoms had always been part of my existing disability. This is not the case, my symptoms have worsened over the past seven years. I was told that they did not know enough about it and I needed to talk to 'someone else with more expertise.' I explained that that is why I requested the referral. They stated that they would 'do some research and telephone me.' In the meantime, all that could be offered was further tablets. However, I did not want this, because I am already on modern patches and have been for several years. I did not want to be treated like a guinea pig, suffering more side effects. When I mentioned that I was worried about any side effects. I was told 'what side effects are you talking about?' (in a coarse manner). They then proceeded in saying that most side effects are 'psychological'. This doctor did not seem to want to give their time and I had the impression they wanted to go home. Furthermore, they did not telephone me with the results of their research. When I telephoned the surgery and spoke to the receptionist, they told me that the doctor was a locum and was no longer working there.\": 1, 'The pharmacy is right next door, convenient': 1, 'I have been with this practice for 15 years and have always found the staff (Drs and prationers) to be reassuring, kind and helpful.

The problem is not in the doctors themselves, but in rude reception staff, and nurses.  There were several mistakes made with the samples I left. Once, one of the nurses poured my urine sample down the drain, not testing it for pregancy as I was asked to bring it for. Other time, I had to come 3 times and give my blood sample because it was put in wrong bottles and the hospital did not want to accept it for tests, at the end, the ladies at the treatment room told me to go to the hospital myself and leave the sample in there. In the meantime, trying to get my blood results over the phone, calling several times a week for a month, I heard different stories - e.g. that the sample was sent to Scotland and it takes a while for the results to come. I wondered who answered that phone, and always regreted I can't remember the names of all the staff I spoke to on the phone. I moved to a different practise but went there today with my daughter, the member of staff at the reception desk was rude again, did not want to notify the nurses that we came, they showed us the computer so we could log in ourselves, I can understand that, but we haven't been there for a long time, and we did not know such service is now available, and the mamber of staff was definitely not satisfied that we interrupted their discussion with their colleague. When it was our time to go in, we went to the treatment room (we came for a booster) I saw a patient inside so I apologised and asked if I was in a correct room, a very rude nurse nearly shouted 'no' and said to go back to reception desk and ask where to go. Not wanting to disturb the the reception desk, we found the correct room ourselves and finally got what we came for.

I felt they looked down on me because I dared ask about insomnia, one of the conditions for which 'abusable' drugs are sometimes prescribed. All I got told is 'you can't have sleeping pills!' before I had even thought about them! I'm too young for help with this apparantly! This doctor's advice was 'warm milk & nytol', dispite the fact nytol and it's other generics have an opposite effect on me, and can actualy prevent me from sleeping and send my brain into overdrive. I didn't have chance to explain this, I just wanted to get out. There was another minor skin issue which I mentioned, they looked at it with disgust! \\n\\nI thought perhaps my insomnia might be coming from another medical condition like my menstrual problems, and I figured they might be able to check me out to make sure my general health was ok. \\n\\nHowever, even though sleeping pills were not on the forefront of my mind then, why does the NHS sanction their use, but GP's refuse to prescribe them to people who are genuinly struggling? Chances are while I was refused, a professional drug abuser was able to obtain an NHS prescription for these meds somewhere else!

Both these doctors are extremely positive with my children, and are able to deal with any fears or anxieties they may feel. Referrals, where necessary have been made quickly, and chased up if needed.

Recently i have sat and overheard many scarastic and unfair remarks towards the staff and the running of the centre. Sometimes of a very small delay. The machinery at any medical cente does not work and should not work as fast as the internet or mobile.

There's plenty of choice of doctors and so it's easy to move about until you find one that suits you. Although, I've seen several of them and have found them all to be generally pretty understanding, easy to talk to and determined to sort out your problem. In particular, I've found two of the doctors I have seen to have these qualities, as well as being friendly, very well mannered and quick to refer you when necessary.

I alway get the impression that the receptionists job is to stop anyone from actually coming into contact with a GP.': 1, 'Because there is \"only one phone line\" at reception, I have to call 10, 15, or 20 times before getting through. Even when the phone rings, often noone picks up.

When I registered here (which the receptionist was so very helpful and despite me walking in 10 mins before they closed still did it!) I could not believe the amount of information given to me - as I work out of town a lot, it was nice to see a schedule so I could book my appointments and work around that.  \\n\\nAll my appointments were informative and helpful.  I have NEVER had any group of people so involved in getting me healthy.  There was an focus on specifics, my test were scheduled appropriately and I was informed about my progress every step of the way.  The staff were very friendly and cared! Rather than telling me to \"exercise and eat less\", I was spoken to about choices I make, and how to keep healthy.  I never felt patronised, or stressed before or after my appointments.  I felt like we were a team working towards something.  \\n\\nI am sad that I am moving out of the area.  I would have loved to continue my road to recovery with them.\\n\\nBest of luck to all the team at Somergrove.': 1, 'When I do get to see a Dr they are generally heplful and caring and we have on occasion received excellent care.

I have a few health problems, as does my son, and we have both always been seen whenever we have needed to. We have always been treated, courteously, professionally and expertly by all members of staff. The doctors are very caring and knowledgeable, and have quite often followed up appointments late by phone, going above and beyond the call of duty.

It is frustrating but I assume if there were a real emergency that risked life then a doctor would come out? On the whole I have found the reception staff good at what they do and as the building is new and purpose built the initial impression at ‘front of house’ is good. This therefore gives the impression of a good practice.': 1, 'Convenient to Park and close to a chemist': 1, \"You can generally get an appointment on the same day if you call in the morning, or you can book appointments in advance with a dr of your choice.

My family put off going to the surgery even when they need to because they worry about the way in which they will be treated. My husband recently wanted an appointment with the doctor (hasnt seen a doctor in 2 years) only to be told by the receptionist he didnt need one  and to deal with his issues himself which actually involved him going to a Pharmacy and paying for tests to be done. When in actual fact someone in his age group is entitled to receive these tests for nothing and he had genuine concerns. Since when are receptionists qualified to make a diagnosis? There are a couple of very nice doctors at this surgery but you will be lucky if you see them on more than one occassion and the majority are extremely patronising. If you have a choice id recommend choosing a different surgery! We are certainly looking to change. I appreciate they can get busy and it is the same story everywhere but ive never felt the need to write a bad review about any other surgery.': 1, 'I have long term health problems but thanks to the doctors and staff at St Annes I have managed to maintain a relatively normal life style,the most important thing for me thy have enabled me to keep working, during my periods incapacity thy have treated me with the upmost respect, and professionalism, coupled with good medical treatment it is not possible to ask for more\\n\\nI would add a special mention of one doctor who truely listens to their patiants\\n\\nI would recomment St Annes highly': 1, 'The surgery is located centrally and easy to find.': 1, 'The doctors are generally very good, show empathy and genuinely appear to care that i get a remedy to what ever symptoms i disclose.\\nI recently had vacinations and the nurse was very efficient and the jabs didnt hurt at all, this appointment was on time and scherduled within a few  days.': 1, 'The staff are usually friendly.': 1, 'whilst cheerful, there have been two errors in one week dealing with my medical needs by admin staff.': 1, 'The receptionists do try and fit in suitable appointmentw at  times which are convenient for the patients.

I recently joined this practice and so far they have provided me better service than my previous GP. Getting appointments is bit tough in this practice but it was easy when they explained me their appointment system. I went to the surgery in the morning at 08:00am as told by reception and I was able to see the doctor at the same time with a few minutes wait. Surgeries policy for children and pregnant women is excellent and emergency service daily is the best thing i've ever come across but would be nice to have it in the evening especially for working class people like me.\": 1, \"There ia very little to like about this surgery. The reception staff are extremely rude and behave as though they are superior to patients for some reason. They refuse to help you and on the counter they try to fob you off. Ive ha many bad expriencea with this surgery and despite their so called 'attempts' to improve, little has been done in way of improvements. One particular incident i shall provide is my most recent involvment with the rection staff. I handed in a request for a medical letter to be written up by the GP, normally i get this from the hospital as i have glaucoma. However as i didnt have a hospital appointment until october and my uni required one immediately i went to the GP. I phoned the surgery a few days after to see if it was ready and a receptionist said yes. I go to collect my letter and the staff then tell me no it is not. So after this constant back and forth tussle i phoned in again the followin week and it was still not ready. The i get a call back from a recptionist and they say its ready now an how the doctor was on holiday, which by the way i was not aware of. And surely another doctor at the surgery could sign it. Thus because of their absolute unprofessionalism i could potentially not graduate this year as the univeristy has now little time to process my grades. This is discusting.\": 1, 'the long hours and weekend hours that are \"displayed\"': 1, 'Not very much unfortunately.': 1, 'i would like to mention the fact, off the the surprise i got to get an appointment within an hour off calling for an appointment..... i rang the surgery around 8 in the morning, and asked for an appointment, to my surprise they gave me one within the hour, and it wasnt it wasnt an emergency....2nd time i have been there since the change off doctors at the surgery, alot off improvment...... thanks': 1, \"I held on the telephone for an appointment throughout the day, barely able to leave my flat. When eventually I managed to stagger along to the surgery, still being held on the phone, the reception was completely empty.  Appalling phone system.\\n\\nApart from which, unless you go in and practically raise hell about having been held for hours, you can seldom get an appointment any time within the next few weeks. I was told I'd have to wait nearly a month, but upon heading in I was able to get an appointment the following day. Well, hurrah! - but, why the inconsistency? It is totally unacceptable that ill patients have to haul themselves along to the surgery to stand a chance of getting something approaching a decent level of customer service from the receptionists. Aloof, uncaring and inefficient.\\n\\nOn a positive note, when I registered (having waited three weeks for that appointment) the nurse was absolutely superb. Perhaps they could teach your receptionists something about patient care.\": 1, 'Again I find myself talking to a brick walls. I contracted the surgery this week and explained they (reception workers) need to be more welcoming and help the non speaking patients they serve. The reception worker does not show any compassion or respect for those people who are unable to speak English. I found my wife to be discriminated against when they tried to arrange appointment for our young child only few weeks back. The reception worker clearly refused to speak Bengali or pass the phone to a Bangladeshi worker who could have arranged the appointment. This week I thought I will try and arrange an appointment for myself, I spoke in Bengali but again the receptionist refused to talk to me in Bengali or pass the phone to someone who could help me, they rudely cut the phone on me when I asked to speak to a senior doctor or the management. I called back and left a massage for the senior Dr who kindly called back. We had a long conversation on this matter and he assured me the staff wills be informed about the matter. I explained I was assured by the practice manager few weeks, but nothing has changed, I found myself in the same situation few weeks later. I believe the practice should sort this problem out soon as possible.': 1, 'Surprisingly I was able to get through the receptionist within 2 minutes of making the call': 1, 'Self touch book in: when it is functioning rather then queuing up!\\n\\nNurse Awareness': 1, 'I am actually quite surprised the comments that these patients have written about the practice. The way i see it is that the more pleasing the surgery tried to do, then the more resistant the people become. Off course, the practice is a big practice with thousands of patients, how many ways can a practice keep everyone of their patients happy. Some time ago, i attended the patient particiaption meeting. Before i attended this meeting, i had negative views about the surgery, but after the meeting, i fully understand what the practce is having to fo through. Yees, the systems are changing all the time but its only becuase they are trying to accomodate all their patients. For instance, the new system for telephone appointments, i rang a few days ago and the manner of the reception was very pleasing. They greeted, introduced themselves and were very polite. i then asked them for an appointment, they offered me a telephone appointment but at the same time before i could enquire further, they took the time to explain to me how the telephone appointment works. Yes everyone goes through a bad experience with some service or another but at the end of the day, i would say St Pauls Way has improved and am most certain will continue to improve. I would recommend patients to attend the patient particaption meetings where i gurantee you will find them very useful. Also a few days back, i attended the surgery for an appointment. A the time of arriving myself, i was informed by the receptionist that the dr was running late and there may be a wait. i was not happy but was pleased that i was infomred about the lateness. whilst waiting in the waiting area, i have come to see that the receptionists are verbally abused, sworn and this is not right. They are human after all, they have feeling to like us and why should they be sworn at for something they have no control over. I believe our patients just find the receptionists as an easy target to pick on.': 1, 'Are receptionist now qualified doctors? Do they have a right to ask patients the reason they want to come and see a doctor? Well apparently they do at St Pauls Way GP Surgery!! \\n\\nAfter getting through to the reception with no luck of finding an appointment via the automated system, i managed to find myself an appointment in 3 weeks time! The receptionist asked me why i wanted to come in and see the doctor, and i politely asked if they were a qualified doctor. They replied no, but apparently the doctors want to know why we want to visit them...does this not happen when we initially go to see them? Besides, what about the doctor-patient privacy?? \\n\\nnyway, after getting an appointment i gave a farewell statement to the receptionist, telling them, \"Thank you very much, have a nice day\". Guess what?! They hang up the phone on me before i could finish my sentence! Sheer disgrace!': 1, 'The Nurse at this practice is very nice and is very happy to give advice, if you can get an appointment.': 1, 'Part of the reason i signed up to this practice was the fantastic opening hours; early, late and saturday opening hours- great i thought, i will be able to fit around my working hours in my job.': 1, 'Nurses are polite and friendly': 1, \"Nothing.\\n\\nI first saw a doctor at St Paul's when I was 12 weeks pregnant - they informed me that I was not eligible for and did not need a 12 weeks scan (even though I am 37 years old and this is standard practice).  I then paid £150 at a private clinic to have the scan only to be told by a midwife several weeks later that of course I should have been referred to have the routine (free) scan at the local hospital at 12 weeks.\\n\\nMy most recent bad experience at St Paul's was this morning when I had made an appointment with a different doctor who rushed me through saying they didn't really have time to spend with me as I was late for my appointment.  My appointment was at 8.54am, I arrived at 8.57am but wasn't called in to see the doctor until 9.14am.  \\n\\nI will not be returning to St Paul's Medical Centre and would advise others not to register despite the limited options in the area.\": 1, 'Tower Hamlets is Multi Cultural and this practice it serves mainly people who are from Bangladesh. I was very surprised when the reception worker said they do no or will not speak to anyone in Sylheti even when the patient’s first language is Sylheti and is unable to communicate in any other language just to make an appointment. When I challenged the reception worker said they are not there to advocate. I am surprised and found myself asking dose she know the meaning of advocating on behalf of someone.': 1, 'I am never able to get an appointment when needed, and have resorted to going to the walk in centre at the Royal London Hospital.  What is really disturbing is that when I came in with my son, who was running a temperature of +40C, I was informed that there were no emergency appointments available on that day nor for teh next 2 days, and the earliest appointment offered was in 3 days time!  Further I was told off that I came in at 2.10 pm whene teh emergency appointments finish at 2 pm.  I was not  aware of the fact. On a previous visit, the GP misdiagnosed my son, dismissing me and telling me that he had a cold and I was over-reacting, whereas in fact my son had chicken pox - I took him to see a private doctor on the same day as I knew that what my son had was not a simple cold. The chicken pox spots were dismissed as a side effect of running a temperature! I myself was also misdiagnosed - once again the favourite \"cold\" was used.  As it turned out. I had pneumonia.

What i have a problem with is the appointment system. Patients are told to call at 8:30am to book appointments & i am usually kept on hold because many other patients are calling at the same time. Being kept on hold whilst phoneing from a mobile costs money so i hang up & call back 15/20 minutes later to be told that the appointments are fully booked or the slot i want is gone. I spoke to the management about this & was told that i don't have to call at 8:30, i can call anytime during the day. if i did that all the slots i want would be filled. The management came across as arrogant & in my opinion couldn't have given a monkeys about the patient, their only concern was defending a farcical appoinment system that i feel is only set up for the benefit of staff & not the patient. Having an all day app system would still work on a 1st come 1st serve basis but this point was conveniently bulldozed. The 0845 number was supposed to be phased out, i see that it is still in use. I'll assume that profit is more important than seeing to the people who have already paid through NIC. The management also stated that if i did not like their system i was free to move elsewhere. i was already aware that i had a choice to move & put up with a different form of bureaucratic nonsense.\": 1, 'not much right now.': 1, 'I have approached this surgery because it is listed in the Tibshelf area as registered to provide Yellow Fever Vaccines and was refused the service due to not being a registered patient.\\n\\nI happen to still live in Tibshelf but registered with another practice that does not provide yellow fever vaccines who did refer me to Staffa Health. \\n\\nI was told Staffa Health could provide the vaccine at a charge of &#163;61 and was advised to pick up a form which on approach to hand it in was refused the service.\\n\\nI am disgusted that it seems impossible to get the yellow fever vaccine.': 1, 'Easy to park.': 1, 'Unfortunately there is nothing to like about getting an appointment, the system they use is of no or little value to the patients.': 1, 'Really sad that I have seen 2 doctors here, they dont even look up from the desk when you are talking to them.

Really happy with the services they offer. Fantastic female GPs. Can always get an appointment the same day which is very reassuring with a small child. Have a good range of staff as well as the GPs.

I have private healthcare so make few demands on the GP other than regular prescriptions. Last week my optometrist advised me that I needed a cataract operation but in order to see the consultant I need the GP to refer me to one of the hospitals on the list of my healthcare provider. I met yet another new person on Friday who didnt seem to know the process and when I called on Monday to suggest that I would pick up the referal letter myself ( in order to avoid the postal strike) I was told that it would be Thursday before the letter can be ready. It appeared that someone had to type and print it . 4 days to get a letter which is completeely standard with neither the practice nor the individual GP adding any value what so ever - very poor service indeed.': 1, \"Reception staff have always been helpful and conscientious; have never had a problem getting through.\\n\\nReceptionists prioritise cases, and I have never had a problem getting an immediate appointment when necessary.\\n\\nThe receptionists empathise with the patients, far more than any surgery I have been registered with.\\n\\nGP's are sympathetic, and actually listen to the patient.\\n\\nThere are locums, but these tend to be the same faces so continuity can be maintained.\": 1, 'My wife and I have been very fortunate in having access to the same doctor since we joined the practice 15 years ago.

Also think the other doctor is very friendly and full of energy and makes you feel at ease. Since the other receptionist has left I really have a better experience with the front desk. They had been there for several years and always very rude and had a bad attitude. So I was delighted to find out they had gone earlier this year. The present team that is there now are good and friendly.': 1, 'Although registered with this Practice for a number of years I only rarely visited as my health had been good. Sadly however things change and over the past year I have had reason to attend much more frequently. The GP who I have seen on every visit is the doctor whom I have found to be friendly,  knowledgeable and articulate and I consider they have always treated me with respect and provided well intentioned measured advice.\\n\\nI am only providing this feedback as there appears to be a number of unsatisfied clients whose experiences are at odds with my own to the extent that I find it difficult to believe we are visiting the same practice.': 1, \"I have moved various times in my life and have had to visit many different GP's.  I must say that Chineham Medical Practice is by far the best GP surgery I have visited.\\n\\nI have seen many of the GPs that work here and each one has been attentive and engaging.  The level of treatment is extremely high.  I have even had to have a couple of procedures carried out which went without incident.\\n\\nOther things that I like are the self service sign in computer when you arrive - makes the whole experience more private.  Also the screen in the waiting room that keeps patients up to date is very good.\": 1, \"The GPs I see in the praciice are very kind and thorough. They don't rush you or dismiss any worries that you have. I rarely make an appointment with the other GPs , but have no complaints about them. I am not allowed to name individuals on here, but the GP I am registered with here is the best GP I have ever had!\\n\\nThe waiting room area is adequate with plenty of chairs. I particularly like the box on the wall that lets you know when it is your turn to see your doctor.

As soon as my family get to know the doctor and begin to have a doctor patient relationship the doctor leaves.  We are not given any notice of the doctor leaving or why they leave.  These last two days theres only one doctor at the practice which limits my choice of doctor.  The doctor at the practice is always rushing and doesnt even undertake a proper examination.

Change the staff, resolve the problem! And put in a local number!': 1, 'The feeling of being made welcome, personal and kindly treatment by all staff from reception to the doctor. The nurses and doctors are patient,  they listen and certainly do not hurry you. Excellent advice and treatment.': 1, 'I just wanted to say that the surgery and doctors I have seen at Gervis have always been excellent. They have arranged follow up consultations with Royal Bournemoth and Poole hospitals quickly and effieciently and have at all times been helpful and caring in their approach.\\n\\nA big thank you for all you have done for me': 1, 'Last time I made an apointment here i had to diagnose myself and hope for the best. What a shambles of a service': 1, 'Excellent staff throughout including reception, nursing and doctors.  All very caring and committed to delivering good patient care.': 1, 'The reception staff are sometimes extreemly busy but always friendly. So are the nurses.\\nDoctors decisions and treatments are competent': 1, 'I decided to join this surgery after I moved home. In order to complete the registration I was given the forms to fill in. I was also asked to bring with me a proof of address and the NHS Medical Card. I told the receptionist that I had the medical card with me and the driver\\'s licence with my current address. Unfortunately, the receptionist wasn\\'t happy with that and refused to register me without the utility bill. I always thought that driver\\'s licence is a legal document that has an address on it and can be used as a form of identification (it even has a photograph). Okay, I thought- maybe the receptionist didn\\'t know that. They asked me to come back with a utility bill. I went back home and came back about an hour later with the bank statement. This time I was served by a different receptionist. I showed them my bank statement together with completed forms. The respond I got was \"Is this the only proof of address that you\\'ve got?\". I just simply could not believe it. Luckily, I was registered. The receptionist then informed be about mandatory health check-up with a nurse. The first available appointment was 9 days ahead. I asked if I could see the doctor before seeing the nurse, I was told that this could not be done until the appointment with a nurse. I wasn\\'t happy with the outcome and I asked for an earlier appointment with a nurse so I could see a doctor. The receptionist informed me that one of the nurses was on holiday and no earlier booking was available. Then the other staff member who was sitting at the back approached the desk and told me to find another surgery if I was not happy with theirs. I personally thought this was said in a rude way and without respect. \\nThe surgery has a strong Zero Tolerance Policy, which was transparent from the moment you walked in (doors, reception desk, leaflets). What about treating the clients with some respect and manner? \\nThumb up for one of the receptionist who advised me to use the walk-in centre in the meantime.': 1, 'The empty waiting room was extremely nice but the service provided is what I am interested in.\\nAlthough the surgery is open long hours I still find it difficult to get an appointment to fit in with my requirements.': 1, 'The warm friendly welcoming atmosphere all the surgery staff showed towards me.': 1, 'Every time I go to the surgery to make an appointment or to be seen, the reception staff takes ages to deal with me, asking me to wait, while picking up the phone or simply ignoring me.\\nI believe that a smile goes a long way as well as some good reception maners. Sadly, you do not get any of that. \\nHowever, the practice is always clean and tidy. \\nThe waiting time with the GP is long as they are often late. \\nI will not recommend it at all.': 1, 'Building is welcoming. There are enough waiting areas and decent toilet facilities.': 1, 'The environment.': 1, \"GP is brilliant.  They care for the family as a unit, listens to us and tries their best to help.  This is why they are so popular and you have to wait a long time to see them.  The current admin system makes this almost impossible.\\nLat visit was for flu jab. I have not been to see my GP for ages, have a list of things to see them about but the last couple of times was not successful in making a suitabkle appointment, so I suppose I'll have to wait until there is a crisis, instead of having apoointments to manage my ongoing symptoms.  Not what I expect of a modern practice.\": 1, \"When ringing for an appointment you are told where in the queue you are, you can ring on the morning for a same day appointment or make an appointment in advance.  You can ask for an appointment with a specific GP and you will get it if you're prepared to wait.

When I do eventually get through - I find I am greeted with a hostile, unhelpful, unfriendly manner. When I eventually do get an appointment, the same attitude awaits in the practice reception.  All of which rude and unfriendly..except that is for one receptionist who I have come to find is professional, friendly and willing to help.

When I needed to come in I didn't have to wait too long and I got to see my own GP.\": 1, 'location': 1, 'Whenever I need an appointment, I can never get an appointment when I need it. Not even for urgent matters. Morning appointments are only booked on the day, so you need to be off that day, miss work, only to get a phone being busy for hour, when you finally get through all the appointments have been taken. The surgery should really invest into call waiting, so people can queue on the line, and not constantly get a line being &quot;busy&quot;. It is extrimely frustrating after having a day off  or lying sick in bed for days and not being able to see a doctor!': 1, 'The Doctors are always thorough extreme polite and knowledgeable about your condition, it always seems that you are their only patient.  The nurses in the practice always show the highest standard of ability and again make you think that you are the only one.

They have been very helpful to me.': 1, 'The doctors have always been very helpful.': 1, \"Great doctors... ive seen a few different doctors and they are all very helpful and professional. There is a downside though, the receptionists could do with cheering up, they never look happy and it's always so busy as its walk in only. Good sometimes but bad when you have to spend over an hour waiting in a very rammed waiting room with people that look agitated. I've had to stand sometimes to wait.\\nCan't fault the doctors though, they are amazing\": 1, \"The doctors have always been fantastic, and i've seen a few different ones. I never feel like i'm being rushed through and they listen to what you say. On one occassion when i had to be referred, i was able to give my preference of hospital and it was all done quickly and efficiently.\": 1, 'I recently moved to the area from NW2 and this surgery is a breath of fresh air. \\n\\nMy previous Dr had fobbed me off with pills and anti-inflammos despite an on-going running injury and being on crutches for 5-weeks. On the day I registered (which can be done any time instead of 11.33 for 2 minutes on a Thursday and only if you have a red top and brown hair), I saw a Dr who assessed my injury fully, referred me to a muscular expert at the surgery who I saw 2 days later, and gave me new tablets.  The 2nd Dr then identified the problem within a few mins and referred me for physio, whilst also recommending exercises to help in the meantime.\\n\\nI am sure not all cases are that efficient, but I certainly think they deserve a mention for the helpful service from both receptionists, nurses, and Dr at the centre.': 1, 'The doctors are lovely, approachable and friendly they instantly put you at ease.': 1, 'I like the open access system. Many GP surgery have waits of up to 2 weeks to see a doctor. Here, you will be seen on the day that you attend.

It is almost impossible to get an emergency appointment and getting past the reception staff is almost impossible. I find the staff on the reception quite unhelpful and very blunt - issues seem to be discussed quite loudly on the phone within the waiting room area. \\nIt is very hard to deal with this surgery if you have ongoing medical treatment especially if you need a follow up appointment/blood test on a specific day. This seems to be something that the reception staff seem to have difficulty understanding and I have found myself having very frustrating conversations with them - also a very patronising answer machine message that you have to listen to before speaking to a person.': 1, 'until recently has been a good surgery': 1, 'All of the nurses that I met were absolutely brillant, put me at ease and as I am someone who gets a little nervous about blood being taken they really helped.

The website which is regularly updated. I can call on any day for advice and if needed, see a GP.': 1, \"The Reception staff are friendly and welcoming.  They do their best to help with all the requests they receive, and are able to deal with different patients and telephone calls without becoming flustered.  My GP is calm, knowledgeable and approachable and always gives me their full attention, listening to what I say - and, more importantly, to what I don't say!  The treatment they prescribe is always appropriate.\": 1, 'I have been with this surgery for about 12 years and have always found the Doctors and staff to be very sympathetic and helpful. The online booking system is excellent but has been a bit difficult to get appointments of late due to the swine flu issue. The doctors and surgery have been particularly helpful with my young kids. Often FINDING an appointment on the day when we have rung in late when they have become ill. Some Doctors are more willing to refer quickly than others but all are open to suggestions and discussion. On occasions Doctors have rung me at home on request to chat things through which is a really nice touch. I would recommend this practice to anyone living in the area.': 1, 'better staff pls': 1, 'I recently visited the Sunlight Centre practice to ask advice about contraception. As I am under 20 I was able to make use of the under-20s walk-in on a Thursday afternoon. This was very easy and made me feel a lot more relaxed as there was no need to book an appointment around my hectic schedule. The staff who I encountered during my visit were nothing but extremely helpful and simply very nice people. The staff running the under-20s walk in clinic especially were extremely easy to talk to and helped me feel at ease.': 1, 'The doctors are fine. The receptionists are rude, sullen and unhelpful. They don\\'t answer the phone and when you finally get through they say you should have phoned earlier and they can\\'t give you an apointment. They act as if asking to see a doctor is such a burden to them.\\n\\nEven when you personally attend they ignore you and do not even acknowledge your existence and perhaps say \"I\\'ll be with you in a minute\". They sour the whole experience of going to see some good doctors.\\n\\nAs an example of professional and courteous receptionists, try the drop in centre in Canterbury St- what a refreshing difference.': 1, \"The receptionists bear the brunt of a considerable amount of patient anger when things don't go the way they want. There are only a certain number of appointments that can be made during the day, which is not the fault of the receptionists. I have witnessed on several occasions staff being subjected to verbal abuse that in other jobs would have resulted in the abuser being ejected from the premises. The working environment does not help. Being adjacent to the Sunlight Cafe makes it extremely noisy, far beyond the recommended levels of noise within an office environment, and the internal radio station and other extraneous distractions only add to the poor working conditions. The telephone system is a joke and has been for several years, again not the fault of the receptionists who have been continually asking for a system that works properly. This practice has many thousands of patients and you will never please everyone. I have had a lifetime of experience in dealing with the public and can only commend the front line staff at the Sunlight Surgery for their professionalism in dealing with all kinds of patients.\": 1, 'Medical staff are generally helpful and polite.': 1, 'nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!': 1, \"I am sad to read the negative comments on this site regarding the receptionists and GP's in this practice. This is a busy inner city practice, and of course it cannot meet everybodys requirements all of the time. I have never found the receptionists to be rude, aggressive or negative in any way  - Of course they can be assertive, for this type of position, dealing front line with the general public, it is a basic requirement of the job. I feel some contributors on this board may be mistaking assertion for aggression and they are entirely different attitudes.\\n\\nAs for the GP's - there are good and bad practitioners of medicine as with any other profession. Obviously I would not name individuals but there are a couple of very good medical practitioners at the Sunlight Centre - I think we are lucky to have them.\\n\\nOverall I am very pleased with the service the Sunlight Centre provides, although I do agree the telephone system can be difficult at times (and I mean the actual telephone waiting time, not the attitude of the receptionists) but this I understand is being worked on.

Nowhere near it at all, so thank you Sunlight Centre GP staff for the care you take of my disabled partner, my teenage son and myself - I for one am very grateful.\": 1, 'You are expected to take an intelligent interest in your own health which has to be a good thing for most people.

On one occasion my daughter suddenly developed a very high temperature while I was seeing the doctor myself and the doctor was swift to react and re-focus their attention on my daughter instead. They suggested that I ought to take my daughter to A&E but listened carefully to my concerns when I explained I was reluctant to go for personal reasons.

No problem with that, except when I saw the nurse they essentially asked me what took so long and I was late as if it was my fault (oh well!). My wife was delayed on arrival by Tube problems and although she phoned  no one picked up the phone (according to her, according to me being at the reception desk at the time they did not even bother to pick up the phone neither to answer my cell phone) . So i told receptionists and nurse that she was late in but still arriving (which she did before I was getting out of my nurse appointment to get registered. Result: they did not let her in because nurse was busy (with me ! for our appointment!) , as I came out they told her the nurse was busy (with whom??) and could not see her because she was late , did not tell them and the nurse had to go anyway (half an hour before closing time?!).

Requested repeat prescription, told to see doctor so I booked in. My appointment was cancelled by them 30 mins before it. I told them I needed tablets urgently but they would not organise prescription so having to wait til tomorrow and queue for duty doctor. In mean time I am in agony and suffering withdrawal symptoms because they would not give me tablets!

Unfortunately the hospital does not carry out those tests and the very next day i called the reception and they said there is no point of me to visit the centre just for refereal. so a message would be passed on to the doctor and i will just have to collect it. Sounds brilliant. Its been 2 weeks and i have been coughing to death, i have called up 3-4 times already and nothing has happened yet. Everytime i was called they said the reception will pass on the message. Pathetic..!!': 1, \"I've been to this practice a couple of times, seeing different locum GPs On one occasion I was kindly seen by the doctor even though I was the last appoint of the day and running very late. In contrary to some other comments here I've been very pleasantly surprised - I was treated with patience and good humour; as far as I can tell the medical advice was excellent and considered; and test results came back quickly.\\n\\nThe building is also pleasant and clean, and desk staff were friendly.

This I had no problem with, except when I saw the nurse they essentially asked me what took so long.  I said I had arrived on time (9:30) and after i finished the paperwork, waited for 15 minutes... by this time it was10am.  They then told me that now they had a backlog of 2 other patients excluding me, as though making me wait 15 minutes was MY fault?  The rest of the registration went fine, they were polite afterwards, perhaps realizing I had nothing to do with their backlog.\\n\\nThen, after calling for almost a week to get an appointment, I went in to check out an ongoing ailment and the only response was that they had no idea.  it took me awhile and some prompting to get them to suggest a specialist, but the stipulation was that if the ailment kept persisting for a few weeks, then they would suggest a specialist.  this ailment has been persisting for years.  I am unsure what a few weeks will change.': 1, 'The doctor that I had an appointment with was on the whole good.': 1, 'When I visited the practice Nurse I was firmly told that as a new patient (at this stage 5 months a patient & admin had not entered my records onto their system ) to make an appointment to see my Doctor first, as they were unable to offer my repeated prescription. I explained that I had already seen my Doctor but the Nurse still said I had to see my Doctor as they said my records were not on the system.\\n\\nI just feel that my time visiting my Doctor could be used for someone who is actually ill, to me the whole point of seeing a practice Nurse is to take some pressure from the Doctors.. \\n\\nAdministration are also to blame for this time wasting for me as a patient & also the Doctor who has to see me again, all for a repeated prescription.': 1, \"I have seen two different doctors at West Hampstead Medical practice. I felt that both listened to my concerns and took them seriously, even though on one occasion it turned out that nothing was wrong. One doctor in particular was patient, kind, seemed genuinely interested, suggested a referral, offered support and wasn't in the slightest bit bothered when I came back two weeks later with pretty much the same problem- in fact they treated it with the same concern and care as if it were the first time round. This is a problem which has bothered me my entire adult life and they are the first doctor who has ever really identified it and taken an interest. \\n\\nAs to comments about continuity of care, I have found that if I request to see a specific doctor, I may have to wait a little longer, but I will be able to see them. This is just the way the world works, and I've never once been told that I'm 'not allowed' to book in to see a specific doctor. i do think that things could be improved by having each patient registered with one doctor and sticking to them, but that's a minor point as far as I'm concerned. \\n\\nFacilities are modern, surgery is clean, reception staff are (on the whole, with one or two exceptions) polite and friendly, waiting area is pleasant enough.\": 1, 'good range of GPs, standards seem to be high, good quality environment, helpful receptionists.': 1, \"There is very little to like about this surgery I am afraid!  The location and the modern facilities are the best that I can come up with.  I'd also say that my experience of the nurses is very good.  They're efficient and friendly.\": 1, 'The Dr I saw, asked and listened to my frustration with the experience I had at the front desk, taking time from what I came in for, however, that is not their job, nor should it be.  Their time &amp; mine is much more valuable.': 1, 'I would like to say as a regular patient that this practice makes a great effort to be modern and efficient and has several exceptional GPs. I find the reception staff firm but fair and always helpful in a crisis. The practice also has an excellent health trainer.': 1, \"Previous experiences have good- efficient & reliable which is exactly what I need with a very busy work life. Getting through to book appointments by phone could be easy & there are regular occasions where the phone isn't answered. That said, I understand that I can use the internet to book appointments which I will do in future.  I have seen a number of doctors in the last 3 yrs and they have always been helpful & understanding, although I have had conflicting information on the contraceptive pill I take. However this is not unique to this health centre and previous doctors have been the same. \\nOn my most recent visit, I have however been very unhappy. My appointment was on the 11th August and following this a referral was to be made to the Royal Free Hospital. By the end of September having not heard anything from the hospital, I contacted the doctors who said the referral was only sent on the 1st September & takes roughly 6 weeks. Why was my referral only sent on the 1st September - this is exactly three weeks after my appointment? So I wait another two weeks thinking that would be six weeks from the 1st September and contact the health centre again as still no appointment. They tell me to contact the Royal Free directly, which I do, only to be told by them that they have not had a referral. I am obviously very unhappy with this & resulted in yet another call to the medical centre. It is the 25th October today & I still have no appointment from the hospital. When I contacted them again this morning I was pleased to hear that they have now had the referral although still no appointment allocated. I asked now long it is likely to be before I am seen - another 4 to 6 weeks. By the time I am actually seen it will probably be early Dec - 4 months since by original appointment. Pretty disgraceful in my view. Not only am I very unhappy about the time it has taken (luckily it's nothing serious), I am upset how much of my time this has taken chasing it up.\": 1, 'GPs are very friendly and provide good care.': 1, 'The Practice is OK as long as you toe the line and don\\'t have too many personal opinions. I noticed the Practice booklet one gets when they join the Practice says something about the \"smooth running of reception\". It says nothing about the smooth running of the surgery for its patients. I thought the Practice was run for the well being of the patients, but this is not apparent in the booklet which amazes me. This is typical NHS \"you get it free so you abide by our rules\" arrogance. We pay heavily for this service over the years and the NHS needs to take heed of this. Therefore the \"customer ethos\" is missing.': 1, \"I was able to have an appointment at 7.30 in the evening which meant that I didn't need to leave work early, for which I was very grateful. I made the visit because I was having some stress and anxiety issues at the time. The doctor I saw listened well to my concerns, was very reassuring and referred me immediately to one of the in-house counselling specialists. I was able to obtain an appointment with them very quickly and found the experience extremely helpful. I appreciated the fact that rather than give me a prescription for anti-depressants or similar, practical help was offered to help address issues that have troubled me on and off for many years. I am still benefiting now from the techniques that I learnt from the counsellor.\": 1, 'Since the retirement of the previous GP’s I have to say the surgery has undergone serious changes, at first I was sceptical as so much happened so fast.\\n\\nI walked in 2 weeks ago and it was as if I was walking into a new building, the walls were bright and the staff were so friendly.\\nI was seen within five minutes of arriving. \\n\\nI have seen there is a lot more staff all busy doing their work, possible why the surgery in my eyes has gone up in my estimations.\\nThe surgery has one receptionist to meet and greet patients whereas in previous years I use to stand at reception whilst the receptionist gossiped and saw me as their second duty.\\nIt’s great to see young and enthusiastic staff within the admin and clinical field \\n\\nI would say I am looking forward to my next visit but that would mean I would be ill again…': 1, \"I have only been at the surgery for two months and due to moving i will be changing doctors.

Within several minutes the pleasant receptionist returned and had a confirmed clinic date at the LRI. \\n\\nI would like to thank you all again for being caring and treating all of us as individuals, I was shocked upon reading the comment below and I cant account for all but every time I have been to the surgery I have been treated with a caring attitude from both admin and doctors. \\n\\nKeep up the hard work': 1, 'We were with the doctor for many years and they were gentle and compassionate.

They do not listen to your description of ailments and concerns, and appear to have a pre-conceived idea of your illness, even if that is entirely different to your own description of symptoms. Even worse, I raised an issue at an appointment a while back but is was brushed aside as inconsequential (unfortunately that issue is still ongoing). I currently have a physical problem however I will not be going to this surgery for advice as I am sick of being takled at rather than with. I am not alone in holding these opinions as several friends also registered at this surgery agreee. It's unprofessional, inhuman and really not anywhere near good enough. People (like me) would prefer to suffer than deal with these intolerable people.\": 1, \"I've had several bad experiences at this surgery. The doctor is ok but it is the other staff that are the source of all the problems. I've had many issues with booking appointements, the staff dont seem to listen to when you say youre available and insist on trying to book me in at times when i have already expressed i will be unable to attend. Once a nurse shouted at me for being over an hour late even though i had proof that the receptionist had made a mistake and booked me in for an appointment an hour and a half before i said i would be able to get there (even though they put the appointment time i wanted on the appointment card). The nurse did apologise but i feel they should have given me the benifit of the doubt before scoulding me like a naughty child! \\n\\nBy far the worst experience was the nurse that did a smear test when i had found a lump in my cervix. That nurse was truly horrible and i dont understand why they would be allowed to behave like that with patients. The nurse didnt say one nice or reassuring thing to me, rolled their eyes when i asked questions (had to ask questions as they literally said nothing to me, they didnt even confirm that there was a lump until i had to ask them myself), they didnt pull out a screen for me to undress behind. In fact the nurse didnt even close the blinds on a window that looked straight out onto the A40! The actual test was brutal and painful and i was in so much pain after that i bled for the rest of the day. They blamed it on me because i wasnt 'relaxed'. I dont know who could be relaxed when some unfeeling nurse shoves a piece of cold plastic inside you with barely any warning! \\n\\nThey made me feel like i was wasting their time and i went home and cried after the experience.

I wanted to be reassured as to my headaches and have a scan but it was never offered to me, they kept prescibing paracetamol that I can just go and buy from Boots myself.\\nBeing French, I am used to a high standard of medical services where the GP always take your blood pressure and listen to your hear beats/lungs at each appointment. I know things are working differently here but I was still expecting some professionalism from these GPs. The ECG I had there, perfomed by a nurse, was incorrect and I had to fly to France to see a cardioligist. Also, the GP never called me to discuss my blood tests results that I have never received. \\nI am not even talking about the premises themselves which really look awful and dirty!! I don't understand why a practice will use carpets everywhere when it is well known that carpets are everything but clean and hygenic!\\nThe nurses there are the only ones who really reassured me by checking me properly. One of them was kind enough to listen to my headaches problems and recommended me to go to France and see a GP there, which I've done and this is why I am not going to this practice anymore. I'd rather fly to my countries and enjoy a high standard medical care.\": 1, \"Doctors' care over the years for my family has been adequate in the main.

Not everyone is good at this, but their skill is consummate and they make this little procedure very comfortable indeed.\\n\\nReception is well-organised and efficient and the prescriptions desk is always ready to help.
